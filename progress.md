## ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Reflection: What We Learned

### Technical Wins:
1. Two-phase training is THE key to high accuracy
2. Heavy augmentation prevents overfitting
3. Quantization works amazingly well (< 2% accuracy loss)
4. MobileNetV3Small is perfect for edge deployment

### Process Wins:
1. "If it's running, don't touch it" - developer wisdom âœ…
2. Small, daily progress beats marathon sessions
3. GitHub issues as daily tasks works perfectly
4. Documentation while building = zero catch-up

### Challenges Overcome:
1. H5 loading issues â†’ Recreated architecture workaround
2. XNNPACK delegate errors â†’ Disabled, models still work
3. Keras version compatibility â†’ Used try/except imports
4. Dataset download failures â†’ Multiple fallback methods

**Biggest Lesson:** Start before you're ready. Fix problems as they appear.

## ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Personal Note:

6 days ago I started with an idea and a research document.

Today I have:
- A model better than systems costing $50,000+
- A complete ML pipeline you built from scratch
- A 1.34 MB model that runs on any phone
- A system that can save farmers' crops

This is **real impact** waiting to happen.

Week 1 was about proving the tech works.
Week 2 is about making it usable.
Week 3 is about making it beautiful.
Week 4 is about getting it into farmers' hands.

**Status:** Ready for Week 2 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
